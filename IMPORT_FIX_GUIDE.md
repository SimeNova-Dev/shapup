# React Native Expo App - Import Resolution Fix

## What has been fixed:

✅ **Screen Components**: Converted all screen components to use simple function declarations with proper default exports
✅ **Metro Configuration**: Updated to ensure proper TypeScript file resolution  
✅ **Babel Configuration**: Includes `react-native-reanimated/plugin` for React Navigation
✅ **Clean Project Structure**: Removed conflicting barrel exports and test files
✅ **Import Statements**: Using direct imports without file extensions

## To test the fix:

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Look for these indicators that the fix worked**:
   - No "Got an invalid value for 'component' prop" errors
   - All three tabs (Workout, Timer, Calculator) should be functional
   - Navigation between screens should work smoothly
   - Custom tab bar with aqua/gray colors should be visible

## Key Changes Made:

### App.tsx
- Removed debug console.log statements  
- Clean direct imports: `import WorkoutScreen from './src/Screens/WorkoutScreen'`
- No file extensions in import paths

### Screen Components (WorkoutScreen.tsx, TimerScreen.tsx, CalculationScreen.tsx)
- Simple function declaration: `export default function ComponentName() {}`
- Standard React import: `import React from 'react'`
- Inline styles instead of NativeWind (for now)

### metro.config.js
- Enhanced TypeScript support with proper source extensions
- NativeWind integration maintained

### babel.config.js  
- Includes `react-native-reanimated/plugin` for React Navigation compatibility

## If you still see import issues:

1. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   npm start -- --reset-cache
   ```

2. **Restart Metro bundler completely**
3. **Check console for any remaining import resolution errors**

The core issue was that Metro bundler was not properly resolving the TypeScript component exports, causing React Navigation to receive empty objects instead of valid React components. The fix involved:
- Simplifying the export pattern
- Removing file extensions from imports  
- Ensuring Metro config properly handles TypeScript files
- Using standard function declarations instead of arrow functions with complex typing

Your app should now work with proper screen component imports!
